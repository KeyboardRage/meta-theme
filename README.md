## Documentation
You can use the browser console in order to access a global variable `theme` in order to customize your theme, either through commands, or through your own script.

### Colours
You can change many colours to your liking.
```js
theme.colors;
/*
Produces a list of colors you can change, and their current value:
accent: "#8a7547"
accent_dark: "#766133"
accent_light: "#947f51"
accent_slight: "#8a75471f"
bg: "#121215"
bg_dark: "#000001"
bg_light: "#1c1c1f"
border: "#ffffff"
card: "#ffffff0a"
green: "#2edc5b"
green_slight: "#2edc5b1f"
over_accent: "#ffffff"
over_lighter: "#ffffff08"
red: "#cd1818"
red_slight: "#cd18181f"
rep_negative: "#cd1818"
rep_neutral: "#cdcdcd"
rep_positive: "#18cd18"
slight: "#ffffff30"
text: "#929292"
user_banned: "#cccccc"
user_group: "#8a7547"
user_normal: "#8a7547"
user_staff: "#cd1818"
user_unconfirmed: "#cccccc"
user_upgraded: "#8a7547"
*/
```

Most people will likely want to change the main theme colour, which is called `accent`:
```js
theme.colors.accent = "#cd18181" // Changes theme colour to the default V3rmillion red
```

You can read the source-code if you want further explanation of what exactly each possible color is.

### Effects
Effects are some stylistic flavour of the design; for now that is the blur amount and shadows.
```js
theme.effects
/*
Produces:
blur: "blur(16px)"
shadow: "0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.1),0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.1),0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,.1)"
*/

theme.effects.blur = "blur(8px)" // Halves the blur amount
```

### Custom logo
By default, the theme will switch to a slightly altered logo that will always have the theme color.  
You can also use a custom logo of your own easily too, and revert back to the original one.
```js
theme.setLogoSVG() // Changes to the Meta logo that changes colour
theme.setLogoImage() // Changes to the default logo
theme.setLogoImage("https://full.image/link.png") // Change to a custom logo
```
